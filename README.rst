About GECKO 3
-----------

The **GECKO** toolbox is able to enhance a **G**\ enome-scale model to account for **E**\ nzyme **C**\ onstraints, using **K**\ inetics and **O**\ mics. The resulting enzyme-constrained model (**ecModel**) can be used to perform simulations where enzyme allocation is either drawn from a total protein pool, or constrained by measured protein levels from proteomics data.

**Note:** Regarding code and model compatibility with earlier GECKO versions, see `GECKO 1 and 2`_.

**Citation**

- A GECKO 3 publication is currently under consideration, citation information will appear here in due course.
- For GECKO release 2, please cite `Domenzain et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31421-1>`_.
- For GECKO release 1, please cite `SÃ¡nchez et al. (2017) <https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20167411>`_.

Required software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-	MATLAB version 2019b or later, no additional MathWorks toolboxes are required.
-	`RAVEN <https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN>`_ Toolbox version 2.7.12 or later.
-	`Gurobi Optimizer <https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/gurobi-optimizer/>`_ is recommended for simulations (free academic license available). Alternatively, the open-source GNU Linear Programming Kit (`GLPK <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_, distributed with RAVEN) or SoPlex as part of the `SCIP Optimization Suite <https://scipopt.org/>`_ can be used.
-	`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ for running DLKcat.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**GECKO toolbox**

- The preferred way to download GECKO is via git clone::

   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO

- Alternatively, a `ZIP-archive <https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/releases>`_ can be directly downloaded from GitHub. The ZIP-archive should be extracted to a disk location where the user has read- and write-access rights.

- After git clone or extracting the ZIP-archive, the user should navigate in MATLAB to the GECKO folder. GECKO can then be installed with the command that adds GECKO (sub-)folders to the MATLAB path::

   cd('C:\path\to\GECKO') % Modify to match GECKO folder and OS
   GECKOInstaller.install

- If desired, a removal command is available as::

   GECKOInstaller.uninstall

**RAVEN Toolbox and Gurobi**

- The RAVEN Toolbox Wiki contains installation instructions for both `RAVEN Toolbox <https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/wiki/Installation>`_ and `Gurobi <https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/wiki/Installation#solvers>`_. 

  - Briefly, RAVEN is either downloaded via git clone, as ZIP-archive from GitHub, or installed as `MATLAB AddOn <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/112330-raven-toolbox>`_.

- After finishing all installation instructions, the user should run installation checks in MATLAB with::

   checkInstallation

**Docker**

- Installation instructions are available at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the GECKO folder, ``protocols.m`` contains instructions on how to reconstruct and analyze an ecModel for *S. cerevisiae*.

GECKO 1 and 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Due to significant refactoring of the code, GECKO version 3 is generally not backwards compatible with earlier GECKO versions.

- Most notably, GECKO 3 ecModels have an `.ec` structure containing all enzyme and kcat information.
- In addition, in GECKO 3 enzymes are incorporated in the S-matrix as MW/kcat, while in GECKO 1 and 2 this was 1/kcat (where the MW was instead considered in the protein exchange reactions).
- GECKO 3 ecModels can be stored in YAML file format that retains all model content.
- Most functions in GECKO 3 do not work on ecModels generated with GECKO versions 1 or 2.
- ecModels generated in GECKO 3 do not work with functions from GECKO versions 1 or 2.
- At this moment, there are no Python functions to work with GECKO 3 formatted ecModels.
- The last GECKO 2 release (2.0.3) is available `here <https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/releases/tag/v2.0.3>`_.
- The ``gecko2`` branch remains available for any potential fixes.
