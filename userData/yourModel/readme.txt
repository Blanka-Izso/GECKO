You can duplicate this yourModel folder (and give the new folder a name that is useful for you) for you own ec-model reconstruction and analysis work. The new folder does not necessarily have to be in the GECKO directory under 'userData/', but can be in any location of your choice.

The location of the new folder should be specified in the ModelAdapter.m file under 'obj.params.path'.

You should keep the overall folder structure ('code', 'data', 'models', 'output').
