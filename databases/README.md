- `DLKcatCurrencyMets.tsv` is a table of metabolites that form pairs of currency metabolites when occuring in a reaction together (one as substrate, other as product). This is used by `writeDLKcatInput` to filter out currency metabolites. This file is manually curated to reflect common metabolite pairs, but can be extended to include more model-specific metabolite names. This can either be in this folder (and a pull request to the GitHub repository will make this more widely available to other users), or by keeping a copy of this file in the `data` subfolder of the model adapter folder.
- `DLKcatIgnoreMets.tsv` is a table of small metabolites/ions that `writeDLKcatInput` filters out as DLKcat does not predict kcat values for such substrates. This can either be in this folder (and a pull request to the GitHub repository will make this more widely available to other users), or by keeping a copy of this file in the `data` subfolder of the model adapter folder.
- `max_KCAT.txt` is a collation of maximum kcat values per organism, reaction and substrate, as gathered from BRENDA database by `/src/geckopy/brenda_parser`.
- `max_MW.txt` is a collation of maximum molecular weights per organism and reaction (without explicitly referring to an protein identifier), as gathered from BRENDA database by `/src/geckopy/brenda_parser`.
- `max_SA.txt` is a collation of maximum specific activities per organism, reaction and substrate, as gathered from BRENDA database by `/src/geckopy/brenda_parser`.
- `PhylDist.mat` is a taxonomic tree of KEGG organisms, as generated by RAVEN Toolbox.
